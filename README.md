# Ina
A Discord music bot made with node.js, discord.js v14 and Lavalink, with many features (planned). Free to use for everyone and reliable, always giving you music in the highest quality possible.

### Features / Selling points:
- **High quality:** Uses Lavalink without altering the stream from source initially.
- **Multiple audio sources:** Supports YouTube, YouTube Music, Spotify, SoundCloud, BandCamp, Twitch, Vimeo and HTTP streams, maybe even Apple Music in the future!
- **Easy to use:** Uses Discord's (relatively) new Slash Commands, making the bot easy to use for beginners, with a clean interface.
- **Free forever:** No vote-locked commands, no paywalls and subscriptions. Vote by choice.
- **Reliable:** High uptime of 99.9%, aside from occassional updates, restarts, and server maintenance.
- **Regularly updated:** New features and bug fixes are constantly added, making the bot even more reliable!
- **Open source:** See an error you think you can fix? Go ahead! Don't like the public instance of the bot and want to host your own version? Go ahead!
